# Marketing Agent Project

## Overview
This project contains scripts for marketing analysis and automation using agentic workflows.

## Agentic Workflow Implementation
The script implements an agentic workflow through:
1. **Goal-Oriented Processing** - The agent autonomously processes marketing data to achieve predefined objectives
2. **Iterative Refinement** - Uses feedback loops to improve classification results
3. **Contextual Awareness** - Maintains state between processing steps
4. **Modular Decision Making** - Components operate as independent agents with specific responsibilities

Key agentic features:
- Data processing agents handle different analysis tasks
- Decision-making logic for segmentation and classification
- Automated reasoning for industry categorization
- Self-contained execution with clear input/output boundaries

## Features
- E-commerce industry segmentation analysis
- Website classification using agentic patterns
- Automated marketing agent functionality
